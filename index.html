            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <div id="abt">
            <p>Hi, My name is Andew! Little about me is that I started exploring tech when I was 13. I am cuurently at Raritan Valley Community College to study Information Systems and Technology (ISIT). Im thinking of going into a career of either Cyber Security, Network Administrater, or Web Developer. My more recent "project" is that I am working on my laptop upgrading the ram and storage, swapped out the casing, replaced the battery, and replaced the power adapter that somehow had holes. For context my laptop is a HP 14 dk-1000. It used to be my primary laptop until it no longer met my standards as they where highered in College. I still have it for learning so I can figure out more about computers what ticked where and use it to further my career. I also try to learn code to see what I can do with it. Languages I know are html, css, and a fair amount of python. What languages I am trying to learn now is Rust and Javascript. Relevant classes that I've taken at RV to my career are Essencial Networking, Web Dev 1, and currently taking Interactive Multimedia. As a hobby I generally play video games like Roblox and Minecraft and keep up with tech news like WWDC, Google I/O, and etc. I also like beta testing iOS software. I've been a beta tester since 2020. I run a X (formally known as Twitter) account @TechTalksPage that talks about Technology. My favorite game is Roblox because there are a lot of games on there but I am exploring other games like Jedi Survivor that im currently trying to figure out the gameplay to. I do spend a fair ammount of time on social media. I currently use TikTok, Instagram, and X. I do have Facebook but only to use Messanger to talk to family.</p>

                <h3>Web Dev 1 Final Project</h3>
                <p>In Web Dev 1 I learned a broad  spectrum of concepts in html and css. The concepts I learned ranged from grids andd flex to forms and I even learned about media states. Other than media states the biggest thing I learned was the Nav Bar as well. </p>
